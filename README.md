# Quotebook
Quotebook is a private web application that allows users to share quotes with each other. I developed this application to share quotes with my friends and record any funny things we might have said. Users can add, edit, and delete their own quotes as well as view any quotes that are shared with them by other users. Since this is a private quotebook, only I can control the number of users, but a guest account is available for basic navigation. The application is developed using Amazon Web Serviceâ€™s DynamoDB for data storage, EC2 to host my Python Flask server, and Nginx and uWSGI for deployment.
